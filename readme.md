# About:
Sock it! is a javascript powered chat using socket.io. Clients can connect and chat with each other.

# Feature List So Far & General Notes:
	+ Integrates Octicons by GitHub
	+ Displays currently logged in users.
	+ New users fade in.
	+ Maintains chat history (100 entries).
	+ Logoff event fades out users.
	+ Timestamps added to messages.
	+ Uses Bootstrap and Bootstrap Theme.

## Features To Add:

	1. Use keycodes (see Pacman assignment) to do type detection so users
	can see 'so and so is typing...'

### Need to Do:

- Stylize chat so username has a color and maybe even more spacing between comments.
- Change logged-on color to a gradient green and add an icon?
- Why isn't mobile working? Is it because of the stylesheet issue?
- Add footer with your website/credits.
- Add background BG and icons (Do you need to roll back to Bootstrap 3?)

**Don't forget to create LICENSE on GitHub for THIS and for MEAN HIKE**
